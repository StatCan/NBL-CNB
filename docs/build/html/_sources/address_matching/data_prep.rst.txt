Overview
========
There are three key layers that must be injested, cleaned, and prepped before matching can begin.
The composition of these input files varies widely by jurisdiction so to a certain degree this process
will vary slightly from region to region in order to compensate for these differences. These three layers
are:

* Building Footprints
* Address Points
* Parcel Fabric

All three of these layers must be available in order to to create address to building matches under the
current process.

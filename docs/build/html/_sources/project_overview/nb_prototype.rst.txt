An initial prototype of the NBL was developed in collaboration with the Government of New Brunswick (NB).
NB was chosen as the location for the prototype as it was the best case scenario for open and available data.
The key data was available through the Service New Brunswick (SNB) `open data portal <http://www.snb.ca/geonb1/e/DC/catalogue-E.asp>`_
The following data was downloaded from the open data portal:

* Address New Brunswick: Civic Address Database
* Buildings
* Property Assessment Map

These layers were used as inputs in the matching process as outlined in the address matching process section of this documentation. 
Results were initially created for the City of Fredericton as there was a pre-existing building layer produced by the city that had 
addresses matched to them. This was used to help validate the results of the the address matching process as well as identify issues 
missed in earlier phases of development.

The New Brunswick prototype of the NBL was succesfully completed and an initial output was created for the entire province. This was 
delivered to SNB in June 2022 to aid in improving the accuracy of their address point layer. There were several lessons learned

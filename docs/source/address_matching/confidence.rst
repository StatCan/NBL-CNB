The final step of the matching process is the confidence calculation. Confidence is a numeric score
calculated based off the characteristics of the match. Additionally, secondary sources such as the
National Address Register (NAR) are brought in to add to the calculation wherever possible. It is 
important to note that the confidence score is an arbitrary number and should not be considered an
indicator percent confidence.

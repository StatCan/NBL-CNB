The National Building Layer (NBL) project was initiated under the leadership of the Canadian Council of Geomatics (CCOG), whose membership 
includes representatives from provinces, territories, and federal departments and agencies.

The NBL is the geospatial representation of every building in Canada and associated features (e.g. building use, year built, building height).
It will serve as a structured, interoperable and authoritative layer. One of the primary goals for the further development of the NBL is to 
reduce duplication of effort and create a standard for all building data.

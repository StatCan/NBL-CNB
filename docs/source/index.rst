**NBL-CNB** (National Building Layer) is a project that aims to create a geographic representation for every building in Canada
with associated attributes. This documentation has several main sections organized below. The first titled 'project overview' is a general project overview that describes the
intent of the project itself. The button titled 'Address Matching Process' is a breakdown on how the address to building polygon matching process works. Other sections may be
added to this documentation as the work on the NBL evolves. Finally, the button titles 'Polygon Splitting' links to a breakdown of the polygon splitting methodology.

.. note::

   All documentation for this project is under active development and is subject to change.

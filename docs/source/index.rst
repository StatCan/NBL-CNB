**NBL-CNB** (National Building Layer) is a project that aims to create a geographic representation for every building in Canada
with associated attributes. This documentation has two main sections organized below. One is a general project overview that describes the
intent of the project itself. The other is a breakdown on how the address to building polygon matching process works. Other sections may be
added to this documentation as the work on the NBL evolves.   

.. note::

   This project is under active development this documentation is subject to change.

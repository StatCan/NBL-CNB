The primary goal of this process is to accuratly match address points to building footprints. In order to 
achieve this three key datasets are required:

* Address Points
* Building Footprints
* A Parcel Fabric

Of the three the parcel fabric

The matching process is divided up into several distinct phases described in the pages below.
Also seen below is a page on how to run the matching process on your own data called 'Run Process'.
The information contained on this page gives a description on the ways to run the matching process as
well as an overview on the environments required in order to be able to run the process.
